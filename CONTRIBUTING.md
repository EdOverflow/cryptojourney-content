### Using the issue tracker 💡

### Issues and labels 🏷

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues.

### Guidelines for bug reports 🐛

Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

We take security very seriously at Cryptojourney. We welcome reports from security researchers to ensure Cryptojourney follows the latest recommendations in security.

**We are not interested in social engineering reports.**
