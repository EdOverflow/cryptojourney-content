### Lorenz Cipher

Another cipher machine, which the German military used towards the end of WWII is the Lorenz machine. The Lorenz machine was a rotor stream cipher machine often used by Nazi High Command and famously known to have been Adolf Hitler's cipher of choice. Lorenz machines were attached to teleprinters, in order to encrypt important messages. Each machine model starts with an SZ abbreviation (SZ-40, SZ-42, etc.), which stands for "Schlüssel-Zusatz", the German for "cipher attachment".

#### :radio: The Machine

The Lorenz cipher machine, although not as famous as Enigma, was far more complex than Enigma. Lorenz machines had 12 rotor wheels and each wheel had a different number of pins, which could be set to on or off. The rotor wheels were divided into 3 groups, `χ` ("chi"), `ψ` ("psi") and `μ` ("mu"). `χ` and `ψ` wheels are key wheels and by adding both together they output a key.

Key = χ-Key + ψ-Key

`χ` wheels rotate after every letter that is typed, while `ψ` wheels do not change regularly. The two middle `μ` wheels are responsible for the rotation of the `χ` and `ψ` wheels, and are therefore called motor wheels.

| Rotor number:  |1  |2  |3  |4  |5  |6  |7  |8  |9  |10 |11 |12 |
|----------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Type:           | ψ | ψ | ψ | ψ | ψ | μ | μ | χ | χ | χ | χ | χ |
|Number of pins: |43 |47 |51 |53 |59 |37 |61 |41 |31 |29 |26 |23 |

Lorenz machines used an enciphering method proposed by the American scientist, Gilbert Vernam, to encrypt teleprinter messages. Letters were represented as dots ("•") and crosses ("x") and in order to encrypt the message, the typed letter was XOR'd with the key letter. The XOR of `(•,•)` is `•`; `(•,x)` is `x`; `(x,•)` is `x`; and `(x,x)` is `•`.

~~~
Letter A: x x • • •
   Key C: • x x x •
------------------- (XOR)
Cipher F: x • x x •
