###The Bombe

The Bombe was a device used by the British cryptologists at Bletchley Park to decode German Enigma messages during WWII. The Bombe was designed in 1939 at the UK Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), a peace-time codebreaking agency, by Alan Turing and Gordon Welchman.
In order to decrypt Enigma messages the Bombe had to find out the relative starting positions of the Enigma rotors, the cross-pluggings of the Enigma plugboard and the order of the rotors. The Bombe could not solve everything on its own, therefore some work had to be done by the codebreakers manually. For instance likely pieces of plain-text known as Cribs had to be found by the codebreakers and then inserted into the Bombe machine.


###Roll of Drums

The Bombe had to do one thing, it had to replicate the action of several Enigma machines. A standard British Bombe replicated the actions of 36 Enigma machines wired together, each with 3 drums connected to them to produce the same effect as the Enigma rotors. To recreate the Enigma rotors actions, each rotor drum of the Bombe had two sets of contact and 104 wire brushes that were arranged in four circles, 2 input and 2 output circles. The circles were arranged, so that the 2 output circles were connected with the current passing through the rotors, and the 2 input circles were connected with the current passing in the other direction.
